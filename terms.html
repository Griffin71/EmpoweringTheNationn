        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Empowering the Nation's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>

            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Empowering the Nation's website;</li>
